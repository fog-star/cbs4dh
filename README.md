This repository is linked to the copy of the cbs4dh Colab project about regular expressions. I extracted the chapter headings, and dialogue within Pride and Prejudice as well as the names of the characters with and without their title.
I used various regex "cheat sheets" on the internet and I don't remember a specific one. Most of them were annoyingly overcomplicated. I unfortunately did not have the sheet that was handed out in class at hand and couldn't find a digital version.

I used ChatGPT and Gemini to troubleshoot the regex but their solutions were too long and didn't work, so I just played around until I got it right. I wish I could have extracted the first names as well but I didn't manage to.
However, if you leave the connection of title and last name in place, a distinction between characters of the same last name is very easy.
